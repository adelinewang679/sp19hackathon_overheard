5.	A short description of your app (its purpose and features)
		Our app’s purpose is to create a forum for any user to make her or his voice heard by uploading an anonymous post. We have a feature of tags, which can be used as categories to filter posts and can be added when creating a new post. Furthermore, profile page allows the users to take a look at their liked posts or ones that they themselves have posted. When clicking on a post in a main page, users can view the details of a post, including its title, content, number of likes and etc.
6.	A list of how your app addresses each of the requirements (iOS / Backend)
	- Requirements for iOS
		- Our main page uses two collection views for filters and scrolling posts. Our profile page also has two collection views for viewing posts. 
		- We use NavigationController to navigate through different screens.
		- We integrated our app with the API backend developers created, which keeps a database of all the posts users upload.
